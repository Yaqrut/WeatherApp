Hi, this is Yaqrut. 
In this project, I took a beautiful UI design Weather App from Figma and turned it into a real iOS app. 
I've included cool animations 
like scroll parallax and text transitions when dragging. 
I also animated cards with a scrolling effect along with sliding when switching between segmented control tabs.
